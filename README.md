# Investigating Style Of Play In The NBA

The goal of this project is to tell the story of the last decade in the NBA, through the lens of style of play.  Using a clustering model, we can contexualize and group how  teams played over the last 10 seasons.  

# Executive Summary 
I got data from [cleaningtheglass.com] in the form of various style of play statistics.  I grabbed stats like `Frequency of Three Pointers`, which measures the percentage of a team's total shots that were from three-point range.  I compiled a dataframe of 10 different statistics, for all 30 teams, for each of the last 10 seasons.
